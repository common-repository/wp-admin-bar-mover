Move your admin bar to different locations on your screen or make the admin bar transparent until hovered.

== Description ==

Fix your headaches with the admin bar overlapping your fixed top nav or distorting your layout while logged in by moving your admin bar to different locations on your screen or making the admin bar transparent. Choose from multiple positioning features such as right side, left side and bottom positioning for your admin bar. You can also set the Wordpress admin bar to be transparent until hovered, giving you a better vision of the site overall. Get the benefits of a logged out session while logged in and making changes!

This plugin also supports responsive views of the Wordpress Admin Bar for mobile views. Note that the hover transparency is intentionally disabled for screen widths under 782px due to lack of hover states on most mobile devices.

Admin Bar Positions
1. Top (default)
2. Right
3. Left

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this change the admin bar in the admin menu itself or just while viewing/editing pages on the site? =

This plugin is only intended to alter the admin bar while viewing or editing pages on the actual site while logged in. The admin bar looks and functions great when in the administrative menus in our opinion but leaves some to be desired when live editing the site.

= Will this work on Internet Explorer? =

Maybe. If you've got a recent version that supports CSS3 transitions, the hover states for transparencies should work fine and the overall position should be okay. As per older IE versions, we do not intend to support them. Upgrade your browser!

= Why doesn't the transparent hidden menu work on my mobile device? =

While our plugin does support moving the admin bar to different areas of the screen on mobile devices, we do not support the transparency for smaller screen sizes due to the lack of a hover state.

= What level users can edit the settings for the Wordpress Admin Bar Mover? =

Only administrators. Anyone editor level or down does not have the ability to change this item. This should allow you to use this on your sites which have subscriber through editor level access and modernize your user experience!
